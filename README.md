USA-Table-View
==============
This is a homework project that I wrote for an iOS class taken Fall 2011 - Summer 2012. 

The topics that we covered for this homework included view controllers, the MVC or model-view-controller paradigm of code development.

This code will run on an iPhone 6 or an iPhone 6.1 simulator.

The code will present a table view of an alphabeticized list of all the states in the USA. The detail arrow on the right of each state name in the table leads the user to another page where the state flag is displayed along with some other key info about the state. 

Note - all pngs in this project were provided by the course instructor.
